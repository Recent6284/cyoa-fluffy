:: Opening Credits
Hey all. This is a fun little thing I used to try to learn how to make things in Twine. Don't take it too seriously. 

A little about me: I'm <a href="https://fluffy-community.com/u/recent6284/activity" target="_blank">Recent6284 on Fluffy-Community</a> and I mostly want to experiment with Fluffy fiction as I can't draw for shit. If you want to add any art to any of these pages, feel free to tag me on the boards. When I release an alpha copy of this I'll likely create a thread for it, and things can be tagged there too.

You can submit bugs to <a target="_blank" href="https://towering-anaconda-968.notion.site/19cdf831412581ebb360d700d24c7d6d?v=19cdf831412581768f19000c758d5cdb&pvs=4">the bug tracker</a>. On every page, you should be able to click the "<span id="deadbug"></span>" button to display the current page ID (which will be useful for a bug report).
