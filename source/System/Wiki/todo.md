# Features

|Feature|Priority|Status|Notes|
|---|---|---|---|
|Event Pool|high|Not started|Need to be able to generate multiple passages, tag them as `event` or `event-race` and then have a widget to call random functions based on that.|
|Separated arrays|high|Started|Need to be able to remove options from an array based on conditionals, or change the array referenced by a widget based on conditionals. Usage is "if player is currently on \[passage\], roll a Fluffy/event using *this* instead of default."|
|Finalize day structure|high|Needs refining|Need to figure out how "time block" structure works. Current thoughts are either day-based, or week-based|
|Finalize win condition for Human path|high|Needs refining|Not sure what the point of a human's campaign is, or how the player "wins." Currently no goal besides seeing as many events as possible, and becomes difficult in order to have perpetual play without Fluffy age/dying/etc.|
|Add female art assets|Medium|Done!|Cosmetic, but will keep Fluffies from looking too samey.|

This part is to explain how you get your Fluffy, and how you'll set it up for its life with you.

This chart is current up to 15/04/2025, and mostly so Recent knows what he still has to work on.
