### **How They Work Together**
- **Flavors**: These add personality and influence the *tone* of the Fluffy’s behavior, dialogue, and event outcomes. For example, a **Loving Companion** Fluffy might cry if it feels neglected, while a **Mischievous Troublemaker** might giggle after causing chaos.
- **Stat Pairs**: These handle the *mechanics* of the Fluffy’s behavior, such as how likely it is to obey commands or avoid danger. For example, a **Loyal Clueless** Fluffy (High Obedience, Low Caution) might obediently follow a command to "go play outside" but wander into traffic because it’s oblivious to danger.
