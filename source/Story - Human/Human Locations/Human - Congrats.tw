After your hard work, you finally set out what you wanted to do  ‚Äî you got yourself a Fluffy! Now all that's left is to introduce $fluffyName to their new home, and see where your adventures take you from here.

Based on your Fluffy's stats and your choices, you will go through a cycle of different events, and consequences from those events! There isn't really a goal in mind from here on out, so play until you get bored.

:: Safe Room Intro

Your adventure thus far perhaps caused you to forget about where this was all leading to: back to your home, and the Safe Room.

You were going to keep $fluffyName in their carrier for a small while longer: you had to make sure that everything was just so, before you let them out into their new home.
