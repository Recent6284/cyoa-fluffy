This is a Twine project by John Recent. The aim is to have a couple branches of story, for humans, Fluffies, and smarties.

* Devlog can be found on [Fluffy-Community](https://fluffy-community.com/t/prototype-dev-thread-choose-your-own-adventure-in-twine/69395?u=recent6284)
* Wiki (in a very barebones form) can be found here:
    * Index

## Bugs/Feedback

Each page has a "bug" icon at the bottom which will give you a copy-pastable Page ID that you can use to submit bug reports/feedback/suggestions. I originally had it in a Notion database, but I think that might be a bit too broad; I'll be pointing people to this thread.

**If you have any feedback or suggestions, please post it here. I'm also open to people making art for individual pages/branches, if they want (credit can be provided on-page with links, etc).** 

## Roadmap

|Stage|Status|Notes|
|--|--|--|
|Systems Development|[color=green]**Done**[/color]|Need to move on from creating more systems, mostly because the more I create, the more I'm not going to finish the story. List of most of them can be found [here](https://fluffy-community.com/t/prototype-dev-thread-choose-your-own-adventure-in-twine/69395/42?u=recent6284).|
|Human Branch (Adult Fluffy)|[color=Turquoise ]**In Progress**[/color]|Planning is [mostly done](https://fluffy-community.com/t/prototype-dev-thread-choose-your-own-adventure-in-twine/69395/35?u=recent6284) in flow chat form. Trying to avoid falling into the pit of "more technical systems" while working on it. Looking to complete all "getting your first fluffy" scenarios before moving onto event pool.|
|Human Branch (Foals)|[color=lightcoral]**Not Started**[/color]|Unsure if this will happen, mostly because of vastly different events, and the need for a persistent time/Fluffy Age to signal maturity. Possible winstate includes keeping them alive until maturity.|
|Fluffy Branch (Male|[color=gold]**Not Started**[/color]|I figure male fluffies are going to have a different route than female ones. Hopes include Feral/Domestic routes, but this is ambitious.|
|Fluffy Branch (Female)|[color=gold]**Not Started**[/color]|Different branch due to mummah/children storylines; hopes to include feral/domestic routes, but this is ambitious.|
|Smarty Branch|[color=gold]**Not Started**[/color]|If able to do it, would love to do an *Oregon Trail*-esque herd simulator.|
